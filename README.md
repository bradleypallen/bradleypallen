Currently working on a couple of projects; first, a proof of concept of a Linked Open Data approach to descriptive bibliography, and second, an attempt to learn how applied category theory can improve the practice of enterprise architecture. Below there are also repos addressing a number of topics such as the use of Keras on natural language inference tasks, the use of Skyfield for visualizing satellite passes, different algorithms for the approximation of &#x1D70B;, the calculation of Texas Hold'Em hand win percentages, and a trainer for John Horton Conway's Doomsday algorithm. Note that the Keras code is very dated, but turns out to be the most popular. Mostly a Pythonista but Julia-curious.
