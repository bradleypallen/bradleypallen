I'm [a technology executive and serial entrepreneur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bpallen) who is currently Chief Architect at Merit, a Bay Area startup building a verified identity platform. Previously, I was Chief Architect at Elsevier, and before that, founder/CTO at three startups in the Los Angeles area, achieving successful exits in two of the three. I began my career during the 1980s as [one of the very first knowledge engineers of the expert systems era](https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2020/04/102740341-05-01-acc.pdf), after earning a BS in Applied Mathematics at Carnegie Mellon University. I am also [a Guest Researcher in the INtelligent Data Engineering Lab at the University of Amsterdam](https://indelab.org/). At INDE Lab, I am exploring the evolution of the practice of knowledge engineering and the impact of large language models on that evolution.

Below are some repos addressing a number of topics such as conceptual engineering using large language models (LLMs), using LLMs to evaluate knowledge graphs (KGs) in the context of KG refinement, the detection of hallucinations using LLMs (for the [SemEval-2024 Task-6 SHROOM](https://helsinki-nlp.github.io/shroom/) competition), a linked data catalog of my William S. Burroughs collection, the calculation of Texas Hold'Em hand win percentages, and a trainer for John Horton Conway's Doomsday algorithm.
