I'm [a retired technology executive and serial entrepreneur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bpallen) who is currently [a doctoral candidate in the INtelligent Data Engineering Lab at the University of Amsterdam](https://indelab.org/). Previously, I was Chief Architect at Elsevier, and before that, founder/CTO at three startups in the Los Angeles area, achieving successful exits in two of the three. I began my career during the 1980s as [one of the first knowledge engineers of the expert systems era](https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2020/04/102740341-05-01-acc.pdf), after earning a BS in Applied Mathematics at Carnegie Mellon University. At INDElab, I am exploring the future of knowledge engineering in an era of large language models.

Below are some repos addressing a number of topics such as tableau calculi for non-classical logics, conceptual engineering using large language models (LLMs), using LLMs to evaluate knowledge graphs (KGs) in the context of KG refinement, the detection of hallucinations using LLMs (for the [SemEval-2024 Task-6 SHROOM](https://helsinki-nlp.github.io/shroom/) competition), a linked data catalog of my William S. Burroughs collection, and the calculation of Texas Hold'Em hand win percentages.
