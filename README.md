Currently working on a couple of projects; first, a proof of concept of a Linked Open Data approach to descriptive bibliography, and second, an attempt to learn how applied category theory can improve the practice of enterprise architecture. Below there are also repos addressing a number of topics such as Keras, Skyfield, and miscellaneous investigations into the approximation of &#x1D70B;, calculation of Texas Hold'Em hand win probabilities, and a trainer for John Horton Conway's Doomsday algorithm. Mostly a Pythonista but Julia-curious.
